          From an early age I have always been deeply interested in computing. It was my father, buying me a brand new. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do. Then I built up very good working knowledge of user support in various technology areas from hardware to software including installation, update or upgrade. I also have two major interests and passions which are Maths and Music. I believe they all have a connection which inspire me to learn more and more. I also enjoy playing football and going travel around my country.
